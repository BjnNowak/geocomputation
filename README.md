Below is my cover proposal for the second edition of [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompx.org/post/2023/map-cover-competition/), by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad and Jannes Muenchow. The R script for the map is available [here](https://github.com/BjnNowak/geocomputation/blob/main/script/geocomputation_cover.R). For this proposal, I just added manually the name of the authors, the title and the collection to get an idea of the possible final result.
